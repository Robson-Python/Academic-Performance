# Academic-Performance
Project to evaluate students' academic performance.

This project was my academic evaluation work for my Python course taken at the FEA.Dev institution at the University of São Paulo - USP. I made some improvements from the original project using approaches I learned in other courses and managed to achieve this result.

This is a project for exploratory and predictive analysis of students' academic performance. The dataframe was analyzed, cleaned and modeled. Then I performed the exploratory analysis and, together with the data visualization, I was able to extract the main insights and thus create a predictive analysis to improve students' academic performance.

I also did an Artificial Intelligence project with the variation of new students' grades based on the analysis of the previous project that can be seen in the file alunos_ia.ipynb.
